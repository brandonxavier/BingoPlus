This runs a classic bingo game.  Model can choose a
minimum tip for play, number of cards to use, whether
 the center square is a 'free' square, and subjects for the bingo and counter.

In addition, a 'Tip King'-style counter is also maintained
for additional tipping/show options.

Models should type /rules for additional options available to them.
